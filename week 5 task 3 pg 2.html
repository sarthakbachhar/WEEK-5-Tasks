    <p>What is Web Design?</p>
    <p>
        Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet.
        It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather
        than software development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites
        for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet
        browsers has become ever-increasingly important.
